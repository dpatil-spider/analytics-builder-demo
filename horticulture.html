Huge Energy Savings – Compared to High Pressure Sodium (HPS) lamps versus the LED lighting systems, results showed that LEDs decrease energy consumption by 40%.
<br/>
Ideal for greenhouse top lighting as the sole light source. The linear design and built-in driver technology makes it flexible enough to fit into a small space in a large greenhouse, where it won’t block the sunlight.
The lights are are tunable that support plants during various stages of their growth cycles. This added adjustability lets farmers modify the light output to find the ideal light recipe to maximize yield and various types of crop growth.<br/>
